## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This application requires Google Sheets integration to function. You will need:
- A Google Account
- A Google Cloud project with **Google Sheets API enabled**
- An API Key for read access
- A Google Apps Script Web App deployment for write operations

### Setup Instructions

To use Simple Accounting with Google Sheets:

1. **Create a Google Sheet**:
   - Create a new Google Sheet
   - Create four sheets named: `Income`, `Expenses`, `Invoices`, and `Settings`
   - Add headers to each sheet:
     - Income: `Date`, `Description`, `Category`, `Amount`
     - Expenses: `Date`, `Description`, `Category`, `Amount`
     - Invoices: `Invoice #`, `Client`, `Date`, `Due Date`, `Amount`, `Status`

2. **Get Google Sheets API Key**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google Sheets API
   - Create credentials (API Key)
   - Restrict the API key to Google Sheets API

3. **Set Up Google Apps Script**:
   - Open your Google Sheet
   - Go to Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
   - Copy the **entire code** from `docs/google-apps-script-example.js`
   - Paste it into the Apps Script editor (replace any existing code)
   - **Important:** Make sure to use the provided script - it includes essential CORS headers
   - Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
   - Choose "Web app"
   - Set "Execute as" to "Me"
   - Set "Who has access" to "Anyone" (‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This allows unauthenticated access. For better security, use "Anyone with Google account" and implement authentication)
   - Click "Deploy" and copy the Web App URL
   - **Note:** The URL should end with `/exec` (not `/dev`)

4. **Configure in config.js**:
   - Open `js/config.js` in your text editor
   - Update the `GOOGLE_SHEETS` configuration with your values:
     - `SPREADSHEET_ID`: Your Spreadsheet ID (from the Google Sheets URL)
     - `API_KEY`: Your API Key
     - `WEB_APP_URL`: Your Web App URL (from Apps Script deployment)
   - Save the file

5. **Start Using**:
   - The app will reload and connect to your Google Sheets
   - All data is now stored directly in Google Sheets
   - Changes are saved automatically

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Error when saving data

If you see an error like "Access to fetch has been blocked by CORS policy", this means your Google Apps Script is not properly configured for cross-origin requests.

**üìñ [Complete CORS Setup Guide](docs/CORS-SETUP-GUIDE.md)** - Read this for detailed step-by-step instructions.

**Quick Solution:**

1. **Update your Google Apps Script:**
   - Open your Google Sheet
   - Go to Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
   - **Replace ALL the code** with the updated version from `docs/google-apps-script-example.js`
   - The updated version includes proper CORS headers

2. **Redeploy the Web App:**
   - Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Manage deployments"
   - Click the edit icon (pencil) next to your active deployment
   - Under "Version", select "New version"
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Copy the new Web App URL (it might be the same)

3. **Update config.js:**
   - Make sure `WEB_APP_URL` in `js/config.js` matches your deployment URL
   - The URL should end with `/exec` (not `/dev`)

4. **Verify deployment settings:**
   - "Execute as" should be "Me"
   - "Who has access" should be "Anyone" (or at least "Anyone with the link")

**Why this happens:**

Google Apps Script Web Apps need to explicitly return CORS headers to allow requests from GitHub Pages. The updated script includes:
- A `doOptions()` function to handle CORS preflight requests
- CORS headers in all responses (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, etc.)

Without these, browsers block the requests for security reasons.

### Favicon 404 Error

The "Failed to load resource: favicon.ico" error is harmless and can be ignored. To fix it, simply add a `favicon.ico` file to your repository root.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

Requires a modern browser with ES6+ JavaScript support.

## Data Privacy

- All data is stored in your personal Google Sheets
- You have full control over your data
- No third-party servers or databases
- **Google Sheets integration is required** for the app to function
- Data is only accessible to you and anyone you share your Google Sheet with
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Be careful with Web App access settings - "Anyone" allows unauthenticated access to your data

## Future Enhancements

Potential migration path to .NET Core:
- Backend API for data persistence
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- PDF invoice generation
- Email notifications
- Data export/import features
- Cloud database integration
